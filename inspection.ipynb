# remove NAs
df2 = df.dropna()
df2.shape #only have 1048 rows left - should we use this one?
df.shape #compared to 8378 rows when there are NAs
df2.dtypes #objects and integers (binned integers are objects)

#will continue with df2 but can just copy/paste with df if we decide to use that one instead

#I think it's okay to keep some of the numeric data binned since that might help to find patterns between variables later, but I can be convinced otherwise. What do you all think?

df2['field'] #check

#lowercase everything (including field since they weren't all upper or lowercase in field)
df2['field'] = df2['field'].apply(lambda x: x.lower()) #I couldn't get this to work using cols_to_check for some reason. also tried str.lower but it didn't work, so did it individually instead since only three cols
df2['race'] = df2['race'].apply(lambda x: x.lower())
df2['race_o'] = df2['race_o'].apply(lambda x: x.lower())

#check that all ? were removed/detected as NA -- if use df instead, make sure to convert all ? to NA
